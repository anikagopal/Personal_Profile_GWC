            Welcome to my website! My name is Anika Gopal and I am 15 years old. I                live in Plano, Texas. I am a sophmore at the Hockaday school and a proud co-founder of the GWC club at my school. I am a passionate hobbyist with diverse interests and  enthusiasm for learning new skills. Over the years, I have explored many hobbies, including travelling, playing tennis, drawing , dancing and trying out adventurous sports to name a few! My approach is holistic and creative, seeking out novel ways to engage my interests in exciting and engaging ways. When I was exploring drawing , I experimented with different textures and styles to create unique compositions that reflected my aesthetic. I am an outgoing person and like socialising with friends.I enjoy being physically active, and spend a lot of time playing Tennis. I love to contribute positively to  my community by using my Tennis skills, and one of my favorite places to volunteer is ACEing Autism. This program is for autistic children and adults to grow from social connections through Tennis. Furthermore, I love utilizing technology to further my endeavors. These projects have challenged and taught me new abilities and skills. All-in-all, I relish any opportunity to tap into my multifaceted creativity and explore the bountiful world of hobbies and interests. <br><br>
