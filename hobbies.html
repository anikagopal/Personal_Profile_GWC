    <h3>Travel</h3>
		<p> I love traveling around the world becuase I enjoy learning about other cultures and traditions. My favorite places to visit are beaches, mountains, rainforests, and cities. Not only do I like the break from the monotonous rountine of school and homework, but I am always up to try new activites and learn more about the world. Experiencing other countries and places with my friends and family are the highlight in my memories. Recently, I traveled to Costa Rica with my friends and their families. This trip will be a memory that I will always cherish. All the long hikes and beautiful scenery will always be saved in my mind. No matter the place, I am always up for travel.<br><br>

        <h3>Tennis</h3>
		<p> I have been playing tennis since I was 5 years old. 10 years later, it is still my favorite sport out of the many I have tried. I remember the first time I picked up a tennis racket and stepped onto the court. Over the years of playing tennis, I have made many memories with my coaches, friends, and family. The experiences that I have in tennis are extraordinary and unforgettable, and if I could do it all over again, I would choose tennis all over again. I remember as a little kid watching  Nadal, Djokovic, and Federer compete against each other in the huge tounrnaments. I was always fond of their fun competitive spirit, and one day I hope to go in person and watch history be made at the US Open. Though the big 3 may not be playing, Tennis is a sport I will remember forever.<br><br>

    <h3>Adventure Sports</h3>
		<p> If you asked my friends to describe me in a few words, they would either say dare-devil or down for anything. In Costa Rica, I had to rappel down a mountain with a waterfall. I was the first in our group to try the tarzan swing, which was mounted on an extremley tall platform. My philosphy is "you only live once" which explains my questionable actions becayse if it's fun, I am up for the adventure.  <br><br>

        <h3>Dance</h3>
		<p> I have been learning an Indian classical dance called â€˜Bharatanatyam' for seven years. Each year I get the opportunity to learn a new aspect of the dance and  perform at the recital. I am excited to advance to the next levels for seven more years until I am ready for the Arangetram, or the presentation of the culmination of all my years of learning. I have made many life long friends due to dance and I hope to make more memories for the years to come.
