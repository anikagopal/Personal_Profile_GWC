    <h3>Empower Minds: A single pane of glass for a highschooler's success</h3>
		<p> Empower Minds, my science fair project, was created to  make it easier for students to keep all their work and frequently visited websites/apps in one place. As a high schooler who is always on the move, I tend to traverse through many apps, websites, and programs on a daily basis and check if my schedules allow me to enroll in any upcoming academic resources, extracurricular activities, programs, projects, etc. To solve this problem, I created a website/app designed to be a one-stop shop to help high schoolers visualize and plan their day-to-day activities. I believe that my website will help high schoolers organize all their work, making it easier to access and navigate, thereby increasing productivity.

        <h3>ACEing Autism Fundraiser</h3>
		<p> This past spring, I was able to raise $1000 at the ACEing Autism Racket Run event. This program allows autistic children and adults to learn and grow from social connections threw tennis. I volunteer at this organization often, and I decided to raise money for their cause by making posters and talking to my teachers & friends' parents. I also participated in their tennis tournamnet and 5k run to donate money to spread this organization from north texas to other cities. <br><br>
